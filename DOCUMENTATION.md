## Feature Workflows (Detailed)

### A. Lead Management
1. User creates or imports leads (manually or via CSV).
2. Leads are stored in the `leads` table.
3. Leads can be filtered, searched, and updated via the UI and API.

---

### B. Call Scheduling & History
1. User initiates a call or schedules a campaign.
2. The prompt box is used to define the AI script for the call/campaign.
3. Calls are made via VAPI; each call is logged in `call_history`.
4. Call outcomes (answered, rejected, etc.) are tracked.
5. If a lead is interested, property details are stored in both `call_history` and `leads`.

---

### C. Campaign Management
1. User creates a campaign, selects leads, and enters a prompt (script) and property details.
2. Campaign is sent to VAPI, which calls each lead using the provided script.
3. Campaigns run to completion (no manual resume; can be stopped/deleted by user).
4. Campaign status and history are available in the UI.

---

### D. Property Details Flow
1. Property details are entered in the prompt box during call/campaign creation.
2. These details are sent to VAPI and included in call/campaign metadata.
3. When a lead is interested, property details are stored in the relevant tables and used in notifications.

---

### E. Notifications
1. When a lead is marked as interested:
   - SMS is sent to the lead with property details (via Twilio).
   - Email is sent to the admin (from `ADMIN_EMAIL`) with lead and property details (via Nodemailer).

---

### F. Dashboard & Analytics
- Dashboard displays real-time stats for leads, calls, and campaigns.
- Recent activity and system status are shown.
- (Campaign analytics feature has been removed.)

---

### G. Error Handling & Production Readiness
- All API routes validate required environment variables and return user-friendly error messages.
- Errors are logged with context, but sensitive details are not leaked to the frontend.
- All VAPI API calls from the frontend are proxied through server-side API routes to avoid CORS issues.
