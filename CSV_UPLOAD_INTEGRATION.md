# CSV Upload Integration Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Changes

### 1. Created CSV Upload Service (src/services/csvUploadService.ts)
**New Service Features:**
- **CSV File Parsing**: Validates and parses CSV files with required headers (name, email, phone)
- **Database Storage**: Stores uploaded CSV metadata and individual leads
- **Lead Management**: Retrieves and manages CSV leads from database
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for file parsing and database operations

**Key Functions:**
- `parseCSVFile(file: File)`: Parses CSV and extracts lead data
- `storeUploadedCSV(filename: string, leads: CSVLead[])`: Stores in database
- `getCSVLeads(csvUploadId: string)`: Retrieves leads from specific upload
- `deleteUploadedCSV(csvUploadId: string)`: Removes CSV and associated leads

### 2. Updated Campaign Creator (src/components/CampaignCreator.tsx)
**Major Changes:**
- **Removed**: Template variables functionality (kept only prompt customization)
- **Added**: CSV file upload interface with drag-and-drop
- **Updated**: Lead selection to use uploaded CSV data instead of database leads
- **Enhanced**: UI to display parsed CSV details (name, email, phone, location)

**New Features:**
- CSV file validation (required columns: name, email, phone)
- Real-time CSV parsing and preview
- Lead selection from uploaded CSV data
- Clear uploaded data functionality
- Toast notifications for upload success/errors

### 3. Removed CSV Upload from Other Components
**Cleaned Up:**
- **CampaignManager**: Removed CSV upload button and modal
- **CSVUploadModal**: Deleted entire component (no longer needed)
- **All Components**: Removed CSV upload references and dependencies

### 4. Database Schema Updates
**New Tables Created:**
- **uploaded_csvs**: Stores CSV file metadata and processing status
- **csv_leads**: Stores individual leads parsed from CSV files

**Database Features:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Proper indexing for performance
- Cascade deletion (removing CSV upload removes all associated leads)
- Timestamp tracking for audit trails

## üìä CSV Upload Workflow

### 1. File Upload Process
```
User selects CSV file ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Parsing ‚Üí Database Storage ‚Üí Lead Selection
```

### 2. CSV Requirements
**Required Columns:**
- `name` (required)
- `email` (required)
- `phone` (required)

**Optional Columns:**
- `location`
- `notes`

### 3. Data Flow
1. **File Selection**: User uploads CSV file through Campaign Creator
2. **Validation**: System checks for required headers and valid data
3. **Parsing**: CSV is parsed and leads are extracted
4. **Storage**: CSV metadata and leads are stored in database
5. **Selection**: User selects leads from parsed CSV data
6. **Campaign Creation**: Selected leads are used to create campaign

## üîß Technical Implementation

### CSV Parsing Logic
```typescript
// Validates required headers
const requiredHeaders = ['name', 'email', 'phone'];
const missingHeaders = requiredHeaders.filter(h => !headers.includes(h));

// Extracts lead data with validation
const lead: CSVLead = {
  id: `csv_${Date.now()}_${i}`,
  name: values[headers.indexOf('name')] || '',
  email: values[headers.indexOf('email')] || '',
  phone: values[headers.indexOf('phone')] || '',
  location: headers.includes('location') ? values[headers.indexOf('location')] : undefined,
  notes: headers.includes('notes') ? values[headers.indexOf('notes')] : undefined
};
```

### Database Storage
```sql
-- CSV upload metadata
INSERT INTO uploaded_csvs (filename, lead_count, status, uploaded_at)
VALUES ($1, $2, 'completed', NOW());

-- Individual leads
INSERT INTO csv_leads (csv_upload_id, name, email, phone, location, notes)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6);
```

### UI Components
- **File Upload Area**: Drag-and-drop interface with file validation
- **Lead Preview**: Displays parsed CSV data with selection checkboxes
- **Upload Status**: Shows file name and allows clearing uploaded data
- **Error Handling**: Toast notifications for validation and upload errors

## üéØ Benefits of New Implementation

### 1. Centralized CSV Upload
- **Single Location**: CSV upload only exists in Campaign Creator
- **Consistent Experience**: Same upload process for all campaigns
- **Reduced Complexity**: No duplicate upload functionality across components

### 2. Real Data Integration
- **Database Storage**: All uploaded CSV data is stored persistently
- **Data Persistence**: Uploaded leads remain available for future campaigns
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of uploads and processing status

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time validation and parsing
- **Visual Preview**: Users can see parsed data before campaign creation
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid files or data

### 4. Scalability
- **Database-Driven**: No memory limitations for large CSV files
- **Performance**: Proper indexing for fast data retrieval
- **Security**: Row Level Security for data protection

## üìã Database Schema

### Uploaded_CSVs Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE uploaded_csvs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  filename TEXT NOT NULL,
  lead_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'processing',
  error TEXT,
  uploaded_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### CSV_Leads Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE csv_leads (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  csv_upload_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES uploaded_csvs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT,
  phone TEXT NOT NULL,
  location TEXT,
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. **Create Campaign**: Click "Create Campaign" button
2. **Upload CSV**: Drag and drop or click to upload CSV file
3. **Validate Data**: System automatically validates and parses CSV
